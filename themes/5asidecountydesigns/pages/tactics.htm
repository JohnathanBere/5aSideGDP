  <p>The images below show a situation. This is an exercise in situational thinking. The Black circle dots 
  represent the attacking team whilst the yellow circle dots represent the defending team. On the right hand 
  side of the images there are buttons which can be found. Each button represents a player (Black Dot) that
  can be found on the image of that section, when you press a button a pop up will apear giving you some 
  advice on why you should or shouldn't pass the ball to the collerating player.
